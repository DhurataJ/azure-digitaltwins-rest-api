# Azure Digital Twins REST API reference

This is the reference documentation for the Azure Digital Twins REST APIs. It contains the following content.

## Control plane

The control plane APIs are used to manage your Azure Digital Twins instance as a whole, so they cover operations like creating or deleting your entire instance. You will also use these to create and delete endpoints. These APIs include the following categories:

* [Check Name Availability](docs-ref-autogen/digital-twins/controlplane/CheckNameAvailability.yml)
* [Digital Twins Instance](docs-ref-autogen/digital-twins/controlplane/DigitalTwinsInstance.yml)
* [Endpoints](docs-ref-autogen/digital-twins/controlplane/Endpoints.yml)
* [Operations](docs-ref-autogen/digital-twins/controlplane/Operations.yml)

## Data plane

The data plane APIs are used to manage the elements within your Azure Digital Twins instance. They include the following categories:

* [Event Routes](docs-ref-autogen/digital-twins/dataplane/EventRoutes.yml)
* [Models](docs-ref-autogen/digital-twins/dataplane/Models.yml)
* [Query](docs-ref-autogen/digital-twins/dataplane/Query.yml)
* [Twins](docs-ref-autogen/digital-twins/dataplane/Twins.yml)

They cover operations like create, delete, update, and list (exact operations vary by topic).
